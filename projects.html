                As the pursuit for developing next-generation flight control systems continues, 
                so does the need for intelligent agents which are capable of providing increased autonomy and 
                stability while ensuring safety. Many different models have been utilized in the past, such as 
                gain scheduling. However these techniques tend to incur destability when dealing with varying 
                weather conditions. This is due to their inability to handle nonlinearity in the model. To solve 
                this problem, a nonlinear model is required. One that can be trained offline and adapt in-mission. 
                There are many models to perform the parameter tuning involved for providing stability to aircraft. 
                This thesis showcases one such application, utilizing a recurrent neural network for providing 
                intelligent nonlinear control. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), I have been conducting an effort to develop 
                adaptive flight controllers for unmanned aerial vehicles. The current focus is on an echo state 
                network for performing nonlinear control. It was chosen due to its close adherence to classical 
                control law. An introduction to neural networks and echo state networks is given to provide 
                context of the subject matter. This is followed by a literature survey of current implementations of 
                recurrent neural networks in flight control systems. A discussion is then given on our research goals, 
                focusing on the echo state network and its role within our intelligent flight control system (IFCS). 
                The methodology used to accomplish these goals is then given; both the MATLAB-based prototype and the
                 C++ implementation. The closed-loop simulation system is detailed, including offline and online training 
                 using the FlightGear flight simulator and Athena Vortex Lattace (AVL) flight dynamics analyzer.
                 The thesis concludes with evaluation of results generated during software-in-the-loop and flight testing.

            <h2>Vision based Target Recognition for Unmanned Systems</h2>
            <p>
                The computer vision system developed sits onboard a fixed-wing UAV, and is used to identify the targets and determine their geographical
                location autonomously. For target identification, OpenCV Computer Vision Library, an open source library for
                target identification and tracking is used. 18 Potential targets are identified by a UAV and their locations are
                communicated to the second UAV, UGV, and GCS. It is a crucial part of the mission’s scanning phase. The
                algorithm is implemented in the C++ programming language using the OpenCV Computer Vision library. Testing
                trials were performed on a PC-104 based ReadyBoard computer running the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.
                The trails entailed a series of run-throughs against a red ball as the target being recorded by a gimbaled camera
                onboard the UAV as the Sig Kadet performs a fly-over. The system determines the object of interest’s geolocation,
                shape, and color. The software goes through a multi-pass series of acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, and
                identification.
                For this effort, OpenCV 2.4.9 library was used. The library runs at the heart of our image processing stack,
                particularly within the image acquisition code, which is a modified algorithm taken from the Flea3 FlyCapture
                Software Development Kit (SDK).
