            <p>
            This paper presents the research being done at Cal Poly Pomona on the development of a wireless avionics system for use on UAVs for flight controls research. The avionics system consists of an onboard flight computer for flight data acquisition and processing, and a wireless modem for live streaming of telemetry to and from the UAV to a ground station. The avionics system is being used for the implementation of guidance, navigation, and control algorithms and for hardware-in-the-loop simulation. It will also be used for the implementation of neural network based controllers that are under development. Because of its open architecture, the avionics system can be used for other research topics such as research on obstacle and collision avoidance systems for UAVs. An integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture is being used to reduce the overall weight, size, and power consumption. A commercially available Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is used for increased safety, security, and partitioning.

            This paper presents the research on the development of neural network based non-linear controllers for an airplane UAV. Multi-layer perceptrons are used for the training of networks, both off-line and on-line. The data required for off-line training is generated from a validated non-linear flight dynamics model of the Cal Poly Pomona 12' Telemaster UAV. The off-line trained network using multi-layer perceptrons replaces the inverse transformation required for feedback linearization. On-line training is then accomplished to account for the inversion and modeling error. The controllers are tested in the software-in-the-loop simulation environment using FlightGear Flight Simulator. Simulation results compared with flight data are shown. Also shown are the results in the presence of sensor noise.

                    As the use of unmanned vehicles is increasing, cost effective operation requires
                    collaboration between multiple vehicles. Such collaboration has many advantages such as
                    the ability to handle more complex task, ability to tackle a task with increased robustness
                    through redundancy, increased efficiency through task distribution, and reduced cost of
                    operation. The main problem is to efficiently distribute the payloads and coordinate the
                    actions of the vehicles so that each vehicle arrives at the desired location at an appropriate
                    time. This requires control of individual vehicle and complex network of communication
                    among the vehicles and between the vehicles and the Operator Control Unit which displays
                    position and orientation of each vehicle in the team and alerts the operator of any anomalies
                    in the health of the vehicles and safety of operations. Cal Poly Pomona is currently working
                    on a project that involves two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and one unmanned ground
                    vehicle (UGV). The coordination between the vehicles has been successfully tested for search
                    and rescue type missions. One UAV airplane was used for target identification and the
                    determination of the target location. The second UAV, equipped with rescue package drop
                    mechanism, received the target location from the first UAV and autonomously flew toward
                    the target location. Based on the position of the target relative to the UAV, the flight
                    management computer calculated the release point and autonomously triggered the release
                    of the rescue package. The ground vehicle, which also received the target location from the
                    first UAV, then travelled to the target location autonomously for the confirmation of the
                    package delivery. The same concept can be extended to other military and civilian
                    applications. This paper presents the overall architecture, concept of operations,
                    autonomous navigation of the UAVs and UGV, target acquisition and processing,
                    communication system, and experimental results.

            <p><i>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. American Control Conference. 2016.</i></p>
            <p>
            Application of echo state network (ESN) for the nonlinear control of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented. The data required for the network training is generated using a validated flight dynamics model of the UAV. The ESN is used for both offline and online training. The offline training realizes the inversion required for the feedback linearlization. The online training is then used to reduce the inversion error that results due to the modeling deficiencies. The data required for the online training is obtained in real-time from the FlightGear flight simulator while the UAV is flying in the simulation. The FlightGear model of the UAV is based on the flight validated nonlinear model of the UAV. Results show that the ESN performs very well for the nonlinear control of the UAV with significantly less computational time and simplicity.

            <p>
            A  neuro-fuzzy  hybridization  model  is  a  hybrid  intelligent  system  that  combines  two  popular  techniques  of  artificial intelligence; neural networks and fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic provides human-like natural deduction and automated reasoning, while  neural  networks  provide  a  connectionist  structure  and  capability  for  nonlinear  learning.  Deductive  reasoning  is 
            accomplished using fuzzy sets and a linguistic model paired with IF-THEN fuzzy rules. The neural networkmodel utilized for this hybridization system, is the echo state network (ESN). The ESN provides a sparsely connected recurrent model with a leakrate applied to its current knowledge. Neuro-fuzzy systems provide universal approximation  of  continuous  functions, under mild assumptions of the activation function. This level of approximation lends itself to reasoning in uncertain and impreciseenvironments. As such, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy  flight controller  can be  employed to  control and stabilize unmanned aerial vehicles  (UAV)  in  varying  environmental  conditions.  This  system  thus  provides  the  capability  of  learning  flight  parameter adjustment in said conditions, such as wind gusts. The data required for network training is generated using a validated flight dynamics model of the UAV. The offline training realizes the inversion required for feedback linearization. The online trainingis then used to reduce the inversion error that results due to the modeling deficiencies. The data required for online training isobtained in real-time from the FlightGear flight simulator while the UAV is flying in simulation. Results show that the neuro-fuzzy  controller  performs  very  well  for  the  nonlinear  control  of  the  UAV  with  significantly  less  computational  time  and simplicity.
